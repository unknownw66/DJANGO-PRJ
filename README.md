# Django Online Library Management System üìö

## üöÄ Overview

The **Django Online Library Management System** is a robust web application designed to streamline and automate the management of library operations, including handling student registrations, book management, book issuing/returning, and user authentication. Built using Django, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, this solution enables both students and administrators to efficiently manage library records and activities.

## üîÑ Complete Working Flow

This section explains how different parts of the system interact to deliver a seamless library management experience.

### 1. **User Interfaces**

- **Homepage (`index.html`):**  
  Presents three primary entry points:  
  - Student Registration  
  - Student Login  
  - Admin Login  

- **Registration and Login:**  
  - Students register via a form (`student_registration.html`), which creates a user and a student profile in the database.
  - Admins log in via a dedicated form (`admin_login.html`). Admins have elevated privileges.

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization**

- Django‚Äôs built-in authentication system manages user sessions.
- Views are protected with decorators (e.g., `@login_required`) to ensure only logged-in users can access certain pages.
- Admin and student dashboards are separated by user roles.

### 3. **Admin Panel Functionalities**

- **Add/View/Delete Books:**  
  - Admin can add new books through a form (`add_book.html`).  
  - All books are displayed in a table (`view_books.html`), with options to delete.
- **Manage Students:**  
  - Admin can view and delete students.
- **Issue Books:**  
  - Admin selects a student and a book, then issues the book.  
  - Issued book records are tracked (`IssuedBook` model).
- **Track Issued Books and Fines:**  
  - List of all issued books is shown (`view_issued_book.html`).  
  - The system automatically calculates fines for overdue books.

### 4. **Student Functionalities**

- **Profile Management:**  
  - Students can view and edit their profiles.
- **Issued Books:**  
  - Students see a list of books issued to them (`student_issued_books.html`), including due dates and any fines.

### 5. **Database Models**

- **Book:** Stores book details (name, author, ISBN, category).
- **Student:** Stores student information and links to the User model.
- **IssuedBook:** Records which books have been issued to which students, along with issue and expiry dates.

### 6. **Static & Media Files**

- **Static files** (CSS, JS, images) are managed using Django‚Äôs static files settings.
- **Media files** (e.g., profile pictures) are stored in a dedicated directory.

### 7. **Flow Summary**
